# Neighborhood Event Finder

NYC residents can browse and save events using Neighborhood Event Finder.

Once logged in to the app, users have two ways of finding events: 1) They can browse through the events coming up in their borough, and 2) They can search for events by keyword, zip code, and/or borough.

If a user is interested in an event, she can save it. This saved event will then be shown anytime the user looks at her upcoming events.
