# Neighborhood Event Finder

NYC residents can browse and save events using Neighborhood Event Finder. This app uses the NYC Open Data API to find and gather event information.

Once logged in to the app, users have two ways of finding events: 1) They can browse through the events coming up in their borough, and 2) They can search for events by keyword, zip code, and/or borough.

If a user is interested in an event, she can save it. This saved event will then be shown anytime the user looks at her upcoming events.
